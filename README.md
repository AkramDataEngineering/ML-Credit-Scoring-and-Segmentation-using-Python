# 📊 Credit Scoring and Segmentation using Python

## 📌 Overview  
Credit scoring and segmentation is a crucial process in the finance and banking industry, used to evaluate the creditworthiness of individuals or businesses and categorize them into distinct risk groups. This project focuses on analyzing borrower data to calculate credit scores and segment customers into categories based on their financial behavior. The goal is to help financial institutions make better decisions on loan approvals, interest rates, and credit limits.

## 🛠️ Project Highlights  
- **Credit Scoring**  
  - Built a scoring model inspired by the FICO methodology.  
  - Features considered:  
    - Payment history (35% weight)  
    - Credit utilization ratio (30% weight)  
    - Number of credit accounts (15% weight)  
    - Education level (10% weight)  
    - Employment status (10% weight)  
  - Generated a custom credit score for each individual in the dataset.

- **Segmentation**  
  - Used K-Means clustering to group customers into four risk-based segments:  
    - **Excellent**  
    - **Good**  
    - **Low**  
    - **Very Low**  
  - Mapped these clusters to meaningful risk labels to make them actionable for business decisions.

## 📂 Dataset Details  
The dataset contains **1,000 entries** with borrower attributes such as:  
- **Demographics**: Age, Gender, Marital Status, Education Level, Employment Status  
- **Financial Data**: Loan Amount, Interest Rate, Loan Term  
- **Credit Behavior**: Credit Utilization Ratio, Payment History, Number of Credit Accounts  
- **Loan Type**: Auto Loan, Personal Loan, etc.

---

## 🔍 Key Insights  
- **Credit Utilization Patterns**: Found that borrowers with utilization ratios over 70% are more likely to have poor credit scores.  
- **Payment History Impact**: Payment history is the strongest determinant of creditworthiness.  
- **Customer Segments**:  
  - Excellent customers are low-risk borrowers with strong payment histories.  
  - Very Low customers are high-risk borrowers who might default.  

---

## 📈 Business Value  
- **Risk-Based Lending Decisions**: Enables banks to personalize interest rates and credit limits based on borrower segments.  
- **Portfolio Management**: Helps institutions minimize defaults by identifying high-risk customers.  
- **Marketing Insights**: Segment analysis can drive personalized marketing for cross-selling credit products.

---

## 🧩 Tools & Techniques  
- **Python Libraries**: pandas, numpy, sklearn, plotly  
- **Machine Learning**: K-Means Clustering for segmentation  
- **Visualization**: Interactive dashboards with Plotly for exploring trends in credit scores and borrower profiles.
